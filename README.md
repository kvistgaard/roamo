# Ontologies for Roam Research
This repository contains two ontologies for Roam Research. An upper ontology [ROCO](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/rio/page/H0cr4EuDS) (Roam Core Ontology), defining general classes (such a `Class` and `Property`) and general properties (such as `subclass of` and `same as`); a personal ontology [RIO](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/rio/page/m08rS7jpZ), including ROCO and extending it with classes such as `Person`, `Organization`, `Tool`, and `Issue` and properties such as `author`, `website`, `works at`, and `start time`.
