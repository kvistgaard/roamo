# Ontologies for Roam Research
This repository contains two ontologies for Roam Research. An upper ontology [ROCO](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/rio/page/H0cr4EuDS) (Roam Core Ontology), defining general classes (such a `Class` and `Property`) and general properties (such as `subclass of` and `same as`); a personal ontology [RIO](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/rio/page/m08rS7jpZ), including ROCO and extending it with classes such as `Person`, `Organization`, `Tool`, and `Issue` and properties such as `author`, `website`, `works at`, and `start time`.

## How to install

Import roco.json or rio.json (which will import both) into a Roam graph using .../Import Files.

If you want a subset of RIO, you can get it from the [RIO graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/rio/search). Enter "RIO" in the [Type to search] filed and select the properties and classes you want to use. Then export the selection in JSON or Markdown and import it in you target graph. In this case you have to import separately ROCO from the JSON file here, or a subset of it from the [RIO graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/rio/search).

## How to use

See [Documentation](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/nodebook/page/Lp2iJtG8M) .
